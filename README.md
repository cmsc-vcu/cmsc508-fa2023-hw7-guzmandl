# HR Resume Database

## Overview

This repository contains a relational database designed for managing HR-related information, including details about people, their skills, and assigned roles. The database schema is represented in a Crows-foot diagram, and sample queries demonstrate how to interact with the database using Python and SQL.

## Files and Structure

- `crows_foot_diagram.md`: Displays the Crows-foot diagram illustrating the relationships between tables (people, skills, roles, peopleskills, peopleroles).
- `create_database.sql`: SQL script for creating the database schema with tables and relationships.
- `populate_database.sql`: SQL script for populating the database with sample data.
- `queries_and_results.md`: Contains sample queries along with the expected results, demonstrating how to retrieve information from the database using Python and SQL.
- `readme.md`: This README file provides an overview of the repository and instructions on database usage.

## Instructions

1. **Database Creation:**
   - Execute `create_database.sql` to create the database schema.
   - Run `populate_database.sql` to insert sample data into the tables.

2. **Exploring the Database:**
   - Refer to the Crows-foot diagram in `crows_foot_diagram.md` for an overview of table relationships.
   - View `queries_and_results.md` for sample queries and their expected results.

3. **Sample Queries:**
   - Use the provided Python code to execute sample queries and interact with the database.

4. **Reflection:**
   - Read the reflection section in `readme.md` to gain insights into the learning experience during the assignment.

## Reflection

The development of this database involved combining SQL and Python through the use of SQLAlchemy, providing a flexible and powerful approach to managing team dynamics, skills, and roles. The assignment was a valuable learning experience, and the repository serves as a practical resource for database exploration and interaction.
